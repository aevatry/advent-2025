This is the seventh day of the advent of code calendar.   
To build and run, navigate to the correct directory in a terminal and run ```make run```. This has only been tested on MacOS with clang version 17.0.0.  

For this day, there is only the code for the second part, as the first part can be done with the same source code and a different n (n=2).
